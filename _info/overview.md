Next.js 14 introduces the App Router, which is a new paradigm for building applications using React's latest features. It is a built-in Metadata API that provides a range of SEO features and supports shared layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more. The App Router organizes routes within the app folder, while the Pages Directory automatically creates routes within the pages folder. It supports features such as intercepting routes and split views, allowing the creation of richer and more complex UIs. The routing in Next.js 14 is based on a file-system hierarchy, where URL paths in the browser are determined by files and folders in the codebase, and it follows conventions for proper routing functionality. The App Router is recommended for new applications, and existing applications can incrementally adopt it, or use both routers in the same application.  `we make HTTP requests from the Next.js app to the Flask backend to fetch the user input then we perform our magic and output the finished short.`If you are using Next.js with Python Flask, you can use libraries like Axios in the Next.js app to make HTTP requests to the Flask API endpoints.
