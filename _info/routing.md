Next.js 14 introduced a new routing system that uses an `app` directory instead of the traditional `pages` directory. This new system is based on the file system, where each `.tsx` file within the `app` directory maps to a route in your application. For instance, a `profile.tsx` file within the `about` folder would map to the `/about/profile` route [1, {ts:392}]. 

To create dynamic routes, you can use square brackets `[]` in the file name. For example, a file named `[id].tsx` in the `app` directory would correspond to a dynamic route like `/app/1` or `/app/2`, where `1` and `2` are dynamic parts of the URL [4, {ts:183}]. 

In terms of integrating Next.js with a Python Flask backend, you would typically set up Flask to serve as an API, handling data processing and business logic. On the frontend, your Next.js application would make requests to this API to fetch or send data [2, {ts:5}]. 

To fetch data from the Flask API, you can use the `fetch` function in JavaScript or libraries like `axios`. You can use these within Next.js's data fetching methods like `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` to fetch data at build time or on each request, respectively [3, {ts:0}][6, {ts:0}][12, {ts:0}]. 

For instance, if you have a Flask route at `/api/data`, you could fetch data from this route in a Next.js page like so:

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/data')
  const data = await res.json()

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  }
}
```

In this code, `getStaticProps` fetches data from the Flask API at build time and passes the data as a prop to the React component for that page. 

Remember, when working with Next.js and Flask, it's important to properly handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in your Flask application, as your Next.js app will be making requests from a different origin [2, {ts:5}]. 

Lastly, to handle complex routing scenarios like nested routes, route groups, or parallel routes, Next.js provides features like nested routes and dynamic routes. You can create nested routes by creating a nested folder structure in the `app` directory. For example, a file at `app/blog/[id].tsx` would correspond to routes like `/blog/1` or `/blog/2` [7, {ts:0}][15, {ts:0}]. 

In conclusion, routing in a Next.js 14 application integrated with a Python Flask backend involves creating a file structure in the `app` directory that mirrors your desired routes, fetching data from the Flask API using JavaScript's `fetch` function or a library like `axios`, and handling complex routing scenarios using Next.js's routing features.
